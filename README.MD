This project is to support learning about Restful APIs.

### Commands:

#### Finding the Name of a Docker Container

Weâ€™ll need to provide docker exec with the name (or container ID) of the container we want to work with. We can find this information using the docker ps command:

`docker ps`

This command lists all the Docker containers running on the server, and provides some high-level information about them:


##### "docker build -f [docker File Location Address] -t [Docker Image Name] ."

`docker build  -f ./src/main/dockerBase/Dockerfile -t kbe-rest .`

#### Run docker image

##### "docker run -p [port On Which You Want To Run Docker Image] -d [Docker Image Name]"

`docker run -p 8080:8080 -d kbe-rest`

`docker image ls`

#### Run a Container Interactively  

Docker allows you to run a container in interactive mode. This means you can execute commands inside the container while it is still running.

By using the container interactively, you can access a command prompt inside the running container.  

Command for tun interactively  

##### "docker run -it -p portOnWhichYouWantToRunImage [Docker Image Name]"

`docker run -it -p 8080:8080 kbe-rest`
